# Triplanetary Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the Triplanetary web-based game. The plan is organized into discrete, independently testable phases that build upon each other incrementally. Each phase delivers verifiable functionality and can be validated before proceeding to the next.

## Implementation Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase adds new functionality while preserving existing features
2. **Independent Testing**: Each phase has clear acceptance criteria and can be tested independently
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Phases are ordered to minimize blocking dependencies
4. **Verifiable Progress**: Each phase produces observable, demonstrable results
5. **No Regression**: New phases must not break previously implemented and tested functionality

- **Phase 15**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 16**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 17**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 18**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 19**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 20**: 1 week

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 6-9 months for complete implementation

## Critical Path

The critical path for core gameplay functionality:
1. Phase 1 (Foundation) ✓
2. Phase 2 (Game Board) ✓
3. Phase 3 (Celestial Bodies) ✓
4. Phase 4 (Ship Data) ✓
5. Phase 5 (Ship Rendering) ✓
6. Phase 6 (Physics) ✓
7. Phase 7 (Turn Management)
8. Phase 8 (Plot Phase)
9. Phase 9 (Movement Phase)
10. Phase 11 (Combat Phase)
11. Phase 12 (Victory Conditions)

These phases represent the minimum viable game that can be played.

## Parallel Development Opportunities

Some phases can be developed in parallel by different team members:
- Phase 3 (Celestial Bodies) can be done alongside Phase 4 (Ship Data)
- Phase 10 (Ordnance) can be done alongside Phase 11 (Combat)
- Phase 13 (Scenarios) can be started once Phase 12 is complete
- Phase 15 (Polish) can be incremental throughout development
- Phase 16 (Performance) can be addressed throughout development

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- **Physics Complexity**: Phase 6 is the most complex; allocate extra time and consider using existing physics libraries
- **Performance**: Regular performance testing throughout development to catch issues early
- **Cross-browser Issues**: Test on multiple browsers from Phase 2 onwards

**Scope Risks**:
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to phase definitions; new features go into future phases
- **Timeline Slip**: Each phase has acceptance criteria; don't proceed until criteria are met
- **Over-engineering**: Focus on working functionality first, refactor later if needed

## Testing Strategy Summary

Each phase includes:
1. **Unit Tests**: For all logic and calculations
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interaction
3. **E2E Tests**: For user workflows
4. **Visual Tests**: Screenshot comparisons for UI
5. **Performance Tests**: Where applicable
6. **Manual Testing**: For gameplay feel and balance

## Success Metrics

For each phase:
- All tests passing
- Code review completed
- Acceptance criteria met
- No blocking bugs
- Documentation updated
- Demo/screenshot available

For the overall project:
- Playable game matching original Triplanetary rules
- Smooth 60fps performance
- >90% test coverage
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Positive user feedback

## Maintenance and Future Enhancements

Post-release phases (beyond scope of this plan):
- Online multiplayer
- AI opponents
- Additional scenarios
- Mod support
- Community features
- Advanced campaign modes
- Tournament mode

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured, testable path from the current foundation to a complete, polished Triplanetary game. Each phase builds incrementally on previous work, with clear acceptance criteria and independent verification. The modular approach allows for flexibility in scheduling and resource allocation while maintaining a clear path to completion.
